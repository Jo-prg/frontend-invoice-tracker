# Invoice Tracker

Invoice Tracker is a full-stack web application built to showcase my skills in modern web development. It combines a robust backend with a responsive frontend to provide a seamless experience for tracking invoices. The project demonstrates best practices in both client-side and server-side development, including authentication, data persistence, and secure server actions.

> **Note:** No custom backend code is required for this project. All server-side logic is implemented using [Next.js Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions) and Supabase. This approach enables secure, scalable, and maintainable backend functionality directly within the Next.js codebase.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose:** Track, manage, and visualize invoices efficiently.
- **Features:** 
  - Add, edit, and delete invoices
  - Manage customers and view customer details with invoice history
  - Company branding: upload and manage your company logo and details
  - Responsive UI for desktop
  - Dashboard with invoice summaries and quick actions
  - Modern authentication and routing (sign up, login, password reset)
  - Guest mode: users can try the app without signing up
  - Invoice PDF export and download
  - Invoice status management (Paid, Delivered, Completed, Unsent)
  - Invoice discounts, tax calculation, and currency support
  - Real-time updates and data persistence with Supabase
  - Secure server actions and middleware for access control
  - Accessible design and keyboard navigation
  - Error handling and user feedback via toast notifications

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development for reliability and maintainability
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **React**: Component-based architecture
- **Supabase**: Open-source Firebase alternative providing hosted PostgreSQL, real-time subscriptions, authentication, and storage
